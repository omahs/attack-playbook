## Attack Playbook

### Introduction

The attack playbook is a compendium of relevant hacks, scams, exploits, and general cyber-attacks that occur on Web3 protocols. We have generalized these events, whether it be cyber or real-world attacks, to be specified as <b> attacks</b> or "de-adversarial attacks", regardless of architectural nature. An "attack" is a general cybersecurity term to describe an event of a breach on a digital product or platform. 

Adversarial attacks on ML models such as BERT, GRU, ERNIE, LSTM, RoBERTa, RNN, GPT-3, and more are the inspiration for this framework.

"De-adversarial" attacks are deployed on blockchain-based protocols and products with centralized characteristics or partial-full decentralized architecture, these include cryptocurrencies, NFTs, DeFi protocols, and digital assets. Some of the most gruesome attacks are deployed on smart contracts. 

Here are some Ethereum smart contract best practices: [resources](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/).

Though Rektify AI promotes the DYOR "do your own research" model, as the primary requirement to explore digital assets powered by blockchain, we are even stronger proponents of safeguards and security tooling to protect users. These implementations are infused with a just as powerful emerging technology as blockchain, machine learning, the edge, and more. The intensive study of architecture and methodology of attacks within the blockchain industry is strongly recommended but research needs to be complemented by development.

The "DYOR" model incentivizes users to research relevant risk factors as they invest. We hope that this attack playbook informs users of the risk landscape associated with Web3. Inevitable headaches are the product of information overload that comes from learning about the attacks that occur on digital assets while also learning about the BASICS of the space.

Types of digital assets explored in our Rektify Exploratory Attack Library(REAL):
- Bitcoin
- Cryptocurrencies
- DeFi tokens
- NFTs
- Digital Land
- NFT Gaming
- Metaverse tokens

Running DeFi dichotomy from Rektify AI:
> "All DeFi tokens are cryptocurrencies, but not all cryptocurrencies are DeFi tokens."

Definitions:
1. What is Bitcoin?
> Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency system that allows for global payments. Bitcoin was launched by anonymous developer, Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008.

2. What are cryptocurrencies?
> Any digital currency whose transactions are stored on a blockchain and is not Bitcoin. 
> Cryptocurrencies are digital tokens that represent value on the blockchain:

|  | <b> Token Types <b> |  |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Payment Tokens | Contract Tokens | Currency Tokens |
| Brand Tokens | Non-fungible Tokens | Asset Tokens |
| Metaverse Tokens| Platform Tokens  | Utility Tokens |
| Meme coins | Stablecoins | Security Tokens |

3. What is DeFi?
> DeFi is decentralized finance, an industry created by the collection of traditional finance services that are decentralized using DApps (decentralized applications).

4.  What's an NFT?
> An NFT is a "non-fungible" token, a digital asset that is unique in its existence and stored on a blockchain. NFTs can be considered digital art, digital land, or any item digitized and minted on a blockchain such as Ethereum, Polygon, Celo, and more.

5. What is Digital Land?
> Digital lands are virtual plots of land sold in the metaverse for gaming, investing, projects and other purposes.
> Top Digital Land Platforms:
>- Sandbox
>- Spatial
>- Cryptovoxels
>- Decentraland
>- ULAND
>- OVR
>- SuperWorld
>- Next Earth
>- Pavia

6. What is the Metaverse?
> Virtual world epicenters where avatars can meet up, play games, collaborate, socialize, and more.
